QDaq offers a Javascript interface via the
QtScript module.

One can use this scripting interface either to allow some
user-defined behavior at some point inside a larger C++ application or alternatively to build
the complete application in the scripting language.

It is possible to create QDaq objects from Javascript. These objects will
continue to exist after the scripting session ends, as long as they become
part of the QDaq object tree. Thus, complete
aqcuisition loops can be created and executed in javascript in the same
way as in C++.

Creation of GUI components and interaction between them and
the QDaq objects can also be done using Javascript.

The scripting interface is based on the Qt meta-object system.
When a QDaq object is exposed to the scripting environment,
the signals and slots the QDaqObject-based class are available as methods
of the javascript object. These methods can be called from javascript with the
same arguments as in C++.

Similarly, the Qt properties of the C++ class
become properties of the javascript object and can be read or changed from
Javascript.

QDaq objects has been designed so that the API they offer to Javascript (i.e., their
signals, slots and properties) are sufficient to work with the objects for most purposes.
Only a few special functions or QDaq extensions are acomplished only in C++.

The QDaq class documentation serves also as documentation of the scripting API
as far as the signals, slots and properties of each class are concerned.

@section Started Getting started with QDaq scripting

The easiest way to get started with QDaq scripting is to start the
\ref qdaq_app application, open a scripting console and start
executing Javascript commands interactively.

The QDaq root object (QDaqObject::root()) is already defined in Javascript as the global property "qdaq".

If you type "qdaq" at the prompt and press enter the system reponds by showing that this is
an object of class QDaqRoot with name "qdaq". Similarly if you check the "this" object
the system reponds that it is an object of class QDaqSession:

@verbatim
>> qdaq
QDaqRoot(name = "qdaq")
>> this
QDaqSession(name = "session0")
>>
@endverbatim

You will notice that the console has object introspection, i.e., pressing the '.' after
a valid Javascript expression the system lists all properties and method of a given object.

@section Create Creating objects in scripts

All the classes <a href="#nested-classes">listed above </a> can be created in the scripting
environment by the Javascript new operator with a single parameter, the object
name

@code{.js}
var x = new QDaqObject("objname");
@endcode

A hierarchy of QDaq objects can be built by using the QDaqObject \ref domapi.
Here is an example of script code that creates a loop with 2 channels:

@code{.js}
// create a loop
var loop = new QDaqLoop("loop");
// create a clock channel
var t = new QDaqChannel("t");
t.type = "Clock";
// create a test random channel
var ch1 =  new QDaqChannel("ch1");
ch1.type = "Random";
// create a 2nd channel
var ch2 = new QDaqChannel("ch2");
// create a script job
// that will write to ch2 the square root of ch1
var scr = new QDaqJob("scr");
scr.code = "var v = qdaq.loop.ch1.value(); qdaq.loop.ch2.push(Math.sqrt(v));"
// build the object hierarchy under the root object "qdaq"
loop.appendChild(t);
loop.appendChild(ch1);
loop.appendChild(scr);
loop.appendChild(ch2);
qdaq.appendChild(loop);
@endcode

After the above script code has been executed a call to objectTree()
would return the following:
@verbatim
>> qdaq.objectTree()
qdaq
|--loop
|  |--t
|  |--ch1
|  |--scr
|  |--ch2
@endverbatim

@section Hierarchy Traversing the object hierarchy

The are many ways to traverse the QDaq object hierarchy from Javascript.

All objects are descendants of the root object "qdaq". The child objects of
an object are Javascript properties of that object. Thus, in the above example
we can obtain the object "ch2" like this

@code{.js}
var my_ch2 = qdaq.loop.ch2;
@endcode

Alternatively, if we do not know the path to the object, we can use the built-in
QtScript functions findChild and findChildren which try to find an object
based on its name. All QDaq object must have a name! Thus, to obtain "ch2" with this
method we would do

@code{.js}
var my_ch2 = qdaq.findChild("ch2");
@endcode

If there are more than one descendant objects with the same name, findChild() will
return the 1st that it will find (closer relatives are discovered first).
The function findChildren will return an array of all
objects with the same name.

@section Threads Interactive vs in-loop Javascript

There two different kinds of Javascript environments in QDaq.

The 1st one runs in the main application thread and can execute either interactively
on a console or in the background running some script. This kind of environment
has typically access to all application objects: the QDaq object hierarchy, the UI widgets,
the special functions for system interaction (filesystem, command execution) etc

QDaq has one standard such Javascript environment that is never deleted and it is called
"root script session". It can be accesed by the function QDaqRoot::rootSession().
If we need to define Jacascript functions that must exist throught the lifetime of
the application, then we have to define them in the root session. A typical example of such a
function is when we want to define UI logic in Javascript, e.g. a button press calls
a Javascript funtion that performs the required action.

A second kind of Javascript environment exists only within a QDaqLoop and it serves the purpose of
running code of the loop's QDaqJob objects. This environment runs in the separate loop thread
and has only access to the QDaq objects via the qdaq global object.

If we have QDaqJob objects that need to run Javascript code during execution of their parent loop,
then we must create a scripting engine at the top-level loop by calling QDaqLoop::createLoopEngine().

@section UI Creating user interface (UI) components

In Javascript UI components can be loaded from *.ui files that have been created by
QtDesigner or QtCreator.

There are 2 functions to accomplish this: QDaqSession::loadUi() and QDaqSession::loadTopLevelUi().

Both take a *.ui file name as input and generate a QWidget according to the specifications
in the file. The simple loadUi() function generates a bare QWidget whereas loadTopLevelUi() generates
a top level QDaq window. Using these two functions, a complete UI can be built. This is shown in the
following code example.

The main application window is a tab widget with 2 tabs. We create it in QtDesigner and
give each of the tabs a representative name. The form we create in QtDesigner should
be a plain QWidget or a QTabWidget. Do not use a QMainWindow or other top-level widget
types.

We additionally create in
QtDesigner two widgets that contain all the components (buttons, display fields, etc) that we need in each tab.

The following QDaq script code creates the widgets and combines them to
form the final application window.

@code{.js}
// create top level application window - a tab widget
var w = loadTopLevelUi('tabwidget.ui','mainForm');
// create the widget for the 1st tab
var to = loadUi('tab1.ui');
// find the current 1st tab widget in the main window
var from = w.findChild('tab1');
// replace it with the one loaded from the file
w.replaceWidget(from,to);
// repeat for the second tab
to = loadUi('tab2.ui');
from = w.findChild('tab2');
w.replaceWidget(from,to);
@endcode

To be able to locate the various UI components we have to give them a name
in QtDesigner. Then, when a form is loaded in Javascript, use findChild()
or findChildren() to get the UI widgets.

@section FullApp Creating a full app in Javascript

To create a full QDaq application in Javascript the following steps are needed:
- Create the user interface forms with QtDesigner or QtCreator
- Write a script that loads the UI files and defines the UI logic
- Implement the main application DAQ tasks by means of QDaq objects
- Start your QDaq loops

The application can be executed with the \ref qdaq_app application.

A recomended folder organization is to have a
root folder with the application name, a subfolder named "scripts" for
the script files and a subfolder named "ui" for the *.ui files.
Then \ref qdaq_app is run from the root folder
@code{.sh}
>qdaq scripts/main.js
@endcode
assuming that "main.js" is the application script.

QDaq will create a "log" subfolder to store its log files.

@section Extensions QDaq Javascript tricks

QDaq defines some special Javascript objects.

The ByteArrayPrototype class defines essentially a new Javascript object
class named "ByteArray" that allows low-level manipulation of arrays of bytes.
This is usefull for DAQ work, when we need byte-wise memory access
which is not possible by default in Javascript.

C++ Enumeration types that are properties of QDaq objects are manipulated
from Javascript by strings with the enumeration name that appears in C++ code.
E.g., to set the QDaqChannel::format property we pass a string

@code{.js}
// Create a QDaq channel and set the number format to fixed point
var ch = new QDaqChannel("ch1");
ch.format = "FixedPoint";
@endcode

@section Synopsis A synopsis of QDaq objects

- QDaqObject

Directly derived from Qt’s QObject

- QDaqRoot

The easier way to visualize the hierarchy of objects of the running qdaq session is to use the
Object Browser window of the QDaq IDE. There, all the objects are represented in tree form. The
base qdaq object is a QDaqRoot object.

- QDaqSession

The basic instance of an interaction with all other existing objects and ui’s that do all
the work in data taking. It is designed to function in JS, by providing an “interface” or
“translation service” to C++/Qt’s objects to JS much more nimble and low-weight, pointer-based
objects. Any qdaq console is a QDaqSession object.

- QDaqJob

“Anything that actively *does* something” (instead of just existing) in QDaq.

- QDaqChannel

The basic object for interaction with instruments and data taking, keeping and interacting
with measurements.

- QDaqInterface

QDaqInterface provides a common way to communicate with (hardware) instruments.
The actual communication interface of the instruments connected to the control computer may vary
(examples include GPIB, TCP/IP  and Modbus protocols).

A QDaqInterface has a number of communication "ports", which have different
meaning depending on the specific interface implementation.
On memory/register based interfaces like MODBUS, a port represents the
register number to be read/written. On interfaces that support connection
with multiple instruments (GPIB, RS485), the port is essentially the address of each
instrument. On interfaces that support only
one-to-one communication with an instrument (RS232, TCP/IP) the port feature is not used.

- QDaqDevice

A QDaqDevice is the software representation of a hardware device connected to the control
computer.

In order for the computer to interact with a device, the device and its interface have to
be created as software objects, and the device has to be assigned to an interface. Then,
both the interface and the device have to be opened. At that point, the user can communicate with the device (send commands or get measurements),
according to each devices specific communication protocols (e.g. SCPI commands or even whole
scripts), using just the read() and write() functions.

- QDaqFilter

A QDaqFilter is the software implementation of a mathematical process
(usually quite complicated), that has to be applied online to the values of one or more
QDaqChannels.

At present, QDaqFilters can be:
- FOPDT  (First-Order-Plus-Dead-Time control)
- Interpolator (As the name shows, finds values between measured or available ones)
- Linear Correlator (Finds correlation -linear fitter- between values presented)
- PID (Proportional-Integral-Differential control)

These of course are not all "filters" in the common use of the term.

- QDaqDataBuffer

The basic object of data keeping, where the actual values measured are kept in memory,
relatively organized, before being saved to disk.

Thought the object can function in two alternative ways, either by attaching to QDaqChannels
and reading their content, or by getting values pushed independently by the user,
in practice only the first way of data logging is used.

The data logging involves 4 different objects, 2 QLists:
- channel_objects is a QDaqObjectList, i.e. a QList<QDaqObject>

- columnNames_ is a QStringList, i.e. a QList<QString>

This stores the names of the columns in the sense of C++/Qt object names (which may
be different from the user interface channel names!). This is done in order to have a
human-friendly way to access the two following objects.

And 2 QVectors:
- data_matrix is a QVector of QDaqVector objects QVector<QDaqVector>

QDaqVector is a special QDaq class holding QExplicitlySharedDataPointer objects to other
special QDaq objects (essentially lists of double numbers), see below.
data_matrix is where the data are actually read into, and kept. It can be thought of as a
2-D matrix, where each column represents a channel (QDaqChannel), and each row a measurement
point (presumably done at every iteration of a loop containing the QDaqDataBuffer, and
presumably sync’d with the measurements of the channels. (See below about the concept of a
depth of a data channel).

- channel_ptrs
This is a QVector holding QPointers to QDaqChannels, i.e. a QVector<QPointer<QDaqChannel>>.
This gives an extra handle to interact with the constituents

These four objects have to change in unison in order for the data recording to be well
behaved, and therefore all 4 of them have to be in principle interacted with when interacting
with data.

Qt has tried to provide all methods available to QList also to QVector objects, and vice-versa,
hence all four objects can be treated almost in the same way

It is also implicitly true that the order of objects (QDaqChannels, names, pointers,
data columns) is the same across all 4 objects, to facilitate access, although the objects
are not absolutely ordered in any sense.

A data recording loop that runs without input (e.g. a loop containing a QDaqDataBuffer that
is not running concurrently with any data-producing, i.e. QDaqChannel-containing loop, is
filled with zeros. This behaviour may need to change, in order to separate “real” zero values
from accidental no input.

_Depth_

If the thread of data creation in a channel is too busy to communicate available data to the
thread of data recording (e.g. during very fast loops), data are pushed in a provisional
“buffer”. This process changes the value of special indexes (semaphores), that alert the data
recording thread that data is available. The number of positions of this provisional buffer
can be set for each channel, and is the (data) channel’s “depth” properties

In order for a data channel to be created and deleted successfully, care must be taken to
also ‘populate’ or ‘depopulate’ its properties also.
