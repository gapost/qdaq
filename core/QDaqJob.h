Jobs can be organized as children of a parent-job or children of
the super-class QDaqLoop.

When a QDaqLoop runs all its child jobs are executed by calling their exec() function.
The exec() function first calls run() to perform the actual processing of this job
(if there is any) and
then calls exec() of each child job.

To give an example of the order that jobs are executed, the following job tree:
\verbatim
job0
 |--job1
 |   |--job11
 |   |--job12
 |--job2
 |--job3
 \endverbatim
 will be executed with the following order:
 job0-job1-job11-job12-job2-job3

Before the job can perform its task it must be "armed".
Arming does all the necessary initialization and is implemented in the function
setArmed().

/**
 * @brief A class encapsulating a software loop.
 *
 * @ingroup Core
 * @ingroup ScriptAPI

QDaqLoop is used to execute a number of child-jobs and/or child-loops.

By setting the class properties we can arrange for a number of different
execution scenarios:
  * repetitive with given period
  * repeat for ever or for a given number of cycles
  * skip execution every delay cycles
  * single shot

A QDaqLoop that has no QDaqLoop ancestor is considered a "top level loop"
(isTop() returns true). Otherwise the loop is a child-loop.

When arm() is called on a top level loop, a new QTimerThread is spawned that
calls exec() at each timer repetition.

If arm() is called on a child loop, then it simply arms all child jobs.
The exec() function of a child loop is called from the top level loop thread.

To use QDaqLoop, create the object and build underneath it
a tree of child-jobs and child-loops that
perform the required tasks in the correct order.
Then attach the loop to the QDaq tree either as a child of the root object ("qdaq")
or under another object that does not have a QDaqLoop anchestor. Thus the loop becomes top
level.
